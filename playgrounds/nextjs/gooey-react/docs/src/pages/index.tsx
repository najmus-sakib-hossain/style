      <H1>The gooey effect for React</H1>
      <P large>
        The 'gooey effect' has been made popular by various (amazing) blogposts
        over the years. This tiny component makes it easy to use within React,
        and has improved the implementation. It's optimized to be as sharp/crisp
        as possible, since existing implementations can be a bit blurry. Safari
        support (which can be notorious, and is usually missing) has been added
        as well.
